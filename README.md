# ng4 - Small Angular 4 Projects for Learning and Fun

## First App (`app1`)

__Download Node.js, if necessary__

I tried to upgrade to the latest version (7.7.4 with npm 4.1.2), but was then unable to install the Angular CLI (see below), so I downgraded to the LTS version (6.10.1 with npm 3.10.10). I was then able to install the CLI and create a new Angular app (see below). NOTE: I ran `$ npm cache clean` after each Node.js installation to make sure a package isn't loading anything from npm's cache. Not sure if that was necessary.

__Install CLI tool and create new app__

```
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
$ ng new app1 # 'app1' is the name of the new app
```

__Build and serve it__

```
$ ng serve
```

Visit http://localhost:4200 and you should see "app works!"

## CLI Deep Dive & Troubleshooting

If you want to dive deeper into the CLI and learn more about its usage, have a look at its official documentation: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki

You encountered issues during the installation of the CLI or setup of a new Angular project?

A lot of problems are solved by making sure you're using the latest version of NodeJS, npm and the CLI itself.

__Updating Node.js__

Go to http://nodejs.org and download the latest version. May be good/necessary to uninstall older versions first (Google it).

__Updating npm__

```
$ npm install -g npm
```
(`sudo` may be required on Mac/Linux)

__Updating the CLI__

```
$ npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli
$ npm cache clean
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```

__Some common issues & solutions__

1. EADDR error (Address already in use). You might already have another ng serve process running - make sure to quit that or use `$ ng serve --port ANOTHERPORT` to serve your project on a new port

2. Changes not reflected in browser (App is not compiling). Check if the window running `$ ng serve` displays an error. If that's not the case, make sure you're using the latest CLI version and try restarting your CLI

## Install Bootstrap

From inside the `app1` folder:
```
$ npm i -S bootstrap
```

Edit the `.angular-cli.json` file to include Bootstrap:
``` javascript
"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
```

## Using Custom Components

[Video](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655732?start=0)

## Creating Components with the CLI & Nesting Components

[Video](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655742?start=0)

Example: Generate `servers` component:
```
$ ng generate component servers
```
Same command using shorthand syntax:
```
$ ng g c servers
```

## Formatting With *Prettier*

While I've used Sublime and experimented with WebStorm and VS Code, I'm currently using Atom. To format code, I'm currently using the [prettier-atom package](https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom). `Ctrl + Alt + F`

## Fully Understanding the Component Selector

You can select by element (e.g., `<app-servers></app-servers>`), attribute (e.g. `<div app-servers></div>`), or class (e.g., `<div class="app-servers"></div>`). You __can't__ select by id. Typically use elements with/for components.

[Video](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655772?start=0)

## Practice Making Components (`ass1`)

* Generated one with `$ ng g c SuccessAlert` and one by hand.
* Used `templateUrl` and `StyleUrls` with one and  `template` and `styles` (i.e., 'inline') with the other.
* Used applicable Bootstrap `alert` classes. See this [video](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/practice/266/instructor-solution) for style-by-hand example.

## Data Binding

__Videos__

1. [String Interpolation](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655804?start=0) uses `{{ someString }}`
2. [Property Binding](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655806?start=0) uses `[someProperty]`
3. [Event Binding](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655820?start=0) uses `(someEvent)`
4. Combine 'Property' and 'Event' binding with `[(ngModel)]="someProperty"`

[Property Binding vs String Interpolation](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655814?start=0)

__Which Properties and Events can you bind to?__

Pretty much all of them. Use `console.log(foo)` to see something properties and events.

Example: Binging a method to a click event:
``` html
<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="doSomething()">Do Something</button>
```

## Passing and Using Data with Event Binding

[Video](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655832?start=0)

## Two-Way Data Binding

[Video](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655868?start=0)

For Two-Way-Binding to work, you need to enable the `ngModel`  directive. This is done by adding the `FormsModule`  to the `imports[]`  array in the `AppModule`. You then also need to add the import from `@angular/forms`  in the `app.module.ts` file:
``` javascript
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
```

## Directives

Directives are instructions in the DOM (Components are a type of Directive with a template). Typically add directives with an Attribute selector (but can add with the other ways as well, if want/necessary).

[Video](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655898?start=0)

__ngIf Example__

[Video](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655904?start=0)

``` javascript
<p *ngIf="serverCreated">Server was created, server name is {{ serverName }}</p>
```
The `*` is required because ngIf is a __Structural Directive__, which means it changes the structure of the DOM (in this case, it either adds the Element or it doesn't).

__ngIf else Example__

[Vide](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655984?start=0)

``` html
<p *ngIf="serverCreated; else noServer">Server was created, server name is {{ serverName }}</p>
<ng-template #noServer>
  <p>Server has not been created yet</p>
</ng-template>
```

The `noServer` is called a 'Local Reference.'

__ngStyle__

[Video](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655914?start=0)

`ngStyle` is and __Attribute Directive__. Unlike Structural Directives, Attribute Directives don't *add* or *remove* elements. Instead, they *change* the element they are placed on.

__ngClass__

[Video](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655924?start=0)

__ngFor__

2. Create all other components with the CLI:

```
$ ng g c recipes --spec false
$ ng g c recipes/recipe-list --spec false
$ ng g c recipes/recipe-list/recipe-item --spec false
$ ng g c recipes/recipe-detail --spec false
$ ng g c shopping-list --spec false

  * For the Reactive approach, see the Angular docs [Validators class](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/Validators-class.html)
  * You can also enable HTML5 validation (by default, Angular disables it) by adding the `ngNativeValidate` to a control in your template.

__Setting Default Option Selection__

HTML (standard way, I think, to dynamically populate the options):
```html
<form [formGroup]="signupForm" (ngSubmit)="onSaveProject()">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="status">Project Status:</label>
    <select name="status" formControlName="status" [(ngModel)]="signupForm.statusChoices" class="form-control">
      <option *ngFor="let choice of statusChoices" [value]="choice">{{ choice }}</option>
    </select>
  </div>
</form>
```

TS (the `setTimeout()` is the thing that does the thing):
```javascript
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  signupForm: FormGroup;
  statusChoices = ['Stable', 'Critical', 'Finished'];
  defaultStatus = 'Critical';

  ngOnInit() {
    this.signupForm = new FormGroup({
      projectname: new FormControl(
        null,
        [Validators.required, CustomValidators.invalidProjectName],
        CustomValidators.asyncInvalidProjectName,
      ),
      email: new FormControl(null, [Validators.required, Validators.email]),
      status: new FormControl(null),
    });

    setTimeout(() => {
      this.signupForm.controls['status'].patchValue(this.defaultStatus);
    }, 0);
  }

  onSaveProject() {
    console.log(this.signupForm);
  }
}
```

What if you want to use route protection (`canActivate` to be precise) on lazily loaded routes?

You can add `canActivate` to the lazy loaded routes but that of course means, that you might load code which in the end can't get accessed anyways. It would be better to check that BEFORE loading the code.

You can enforce this behavior by adding the `canLoad` guard to the route which points to the lazily loaded module:
``` javascript
{ path: 'recipes', loadChildren: './recipes/recipes.module#RecipesModule', canLoad: [AuthGuard] }
```
In this example, the `AuthGuard` should [implement the CanLoad interface](https://angular.io/api/router/CanLoad).

## 23: Angular Animations

With the release of Angular 4, the general syntax of Angular Animations didn't change.

However, the animation functions were moved into their own package and you now also need to add a special module to your `imports[]` array in the AppModule.

Specifically, the following adjustments are required:

* You probably need to install the new animations package (running the command never hurts): `$ npm install --save @angular/animations`
* Add the `BrowserAnimationsModule` to your `imports[]` array in __AppModule__
* This Module needs to be imported from @angular/platform-browser/animations'  => `import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations'`  (in the __AppModule__!)
* You then import `trigger`, `state`, `style` etc from `@angular/animations` instead of `@angular/core`
